Why We Ask Candidates to Submit Their Answers in the GitHub Repository

Git is a major transformative technology. It embodies some of the best things that technology can do. When you fully understand how GitHub works you can make important paradigm shifts. Our culture at Photobox requires everyone to be versed with Git as for any project it is absolutely important to use a version control system and at the same time employ a certain discipline with the workflow.
One reason we ask candidates to submit work through Git is because we want to make sure that they understand it. And if they don't, we want to be sure they learn it and improve their skills.

Linus Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, developed Git, and its impact is fascinating because it changed how software development works. In my opinion, Git is one of Torvalds' biggest contributions to the world. Its distributed format changes how we create content, changes how we develop, and changes how we actually create in our society -- and I'm not just talking about software. (Again, need some details ...) (Perhaps delete this paragraph?)

Unfortunately, I don't think Git is as widely used as it should be. This is because it's still not fully understood. Even in technology circles private ownership still dominates. Using GitHub, which is a platform that runs on top of Git, is a really powerful way to create and manage content. Git provides version control and that is the big part of the shift. (Perhaps delete this paragraph?)

Another reason we want candidates to submit within Git is that it gives us a closer look at our programmers (or coders or whatever their job is). A Git repo gives us the backstory on the work and the worker. I expect to see a lot of commits. I expect to see a lot of changes. I expect to see the history of the candidates, how they think, how they operate. Do they do continuous deployment? Do they build systems? 

For me, a candidate just putting a file up there is not that interesting. What I think is interesting, for example, is seeing the process. Getting a look at how people think -- how they work. Do they build their code with tests? Are they are creative? Do they give us the bare minimum, or do they go that extra mile. 

So, providing answers on Git, and in GitHub, provides a great way for the right candidates to join our team as well as providing a very easy way for us to quickly evaluate the candidates and determine if they have what we are looking for.

Ultimately, Git and GitHub are the ultimate levellers. There is nowhere to hide. It's open and transparent. It's a place where the true essence, and in a way, the soul, vision and talent of a person can really shine.
